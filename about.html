                <p>The Star Wars universe began with the 1977 release of the original Star Wars movie, now known as "Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope." Created by filmmaker George Lucas, the movie introduced audiences to a sprawling science fiction universe filled with memorable characters, epic space battles, and a rich mythology. Set in a galaxy far, far away, the movie followed the journey of a young farm boy named Luke Skywalker, who teams up with the smuggler Han Solo and the wise Jedi Knight Obi-Wan Kenobi to rescue Princess Leia and take on the evil Galactic Empire. The success of the original movie spawned two sequels, "The Empire Strikes Back" and "Return of the Jedi," as well as a prequel trilogy and a new sequel trilogy, along with numerous spin-offs and expanded universe materials.</p>
